# Staking sTLOS

As a single-asset staking token, sTLOS mimics the REX-style token staking on Telos native, which does not suffer impermanent loss (as seen in dual-asset staking pools) and therefore presents a far lower financial risk for investors.

sTLOS can be staked on Teloscan. Staked sTLOS provides access to a steady income and our DeFi applications. 
This functionality allows tEVM users to stake sTLOS for attractive rewards while boosting the TVL on Telos' industry-leading EVM. 

Staking TLOS earns you interest, returns, and profits from a community reserve, which distributes to accounts that stake their TLOS and sTLOS. 

Disclaimer: Having sTLOS on the tEVM does not allow you to vote in governance processes (including block producers and worker proposals) - these are limited to the native network.
