## Introduction to sTLOS
Token staking is an important component of blockchain economies that affects tokenomics, governance and project valuation. 
To date, Telos users have enjoyed the benefits of substantial annual returns from Resource Exchange (REX) staking due to inflows from the Telos token reserves while still garnering Telos governance voting rights simply by staking their TLOS tokens into REX.

With the launch and growth of Telos EVM (tEVM), however, the advantages of staking enjoyed by users of native Telos features are not equitably shared by Telos EVM users. Tokens cannot be staked on tEVM into pools that replicate the security, impermanent loss (IL) protection, and governance participation advantages of native TLOS staking. 
This divides the rewards to Telos users depending on the sub-platform (native or EVM) that they engage in, which is outside the ethos of the Telos community. 

This proposal aims to begin to correct this imbalance and provide other benefits, such as increasing the Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi protocols on the overall Telos network.

The method for addressing this is to create a staking mechanism suitable for the tEVM ecosystem that best equalizes the benefits across users of both platforms. 
This new tEVM staking mechanism is called sTLOS, or single-asset staked TLOS, on the Telos EVM that will allow users to receive similar benefits to those enjoyed by native TLOS stakers, while expanding the ability for TVL on the overall Telos network.
